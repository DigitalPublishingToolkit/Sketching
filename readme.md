this code is meant to become a reading application for sketching. The way to currently view it is by installing on a webserver (nothing fancy, all functionality is just HTML and Javascript). 

Recommended to view on iPad: 

- open in safari
- add to homescreen
- view web-application via the link you just created (now in fullscreen)

Next step is application packaging via phonegap.
